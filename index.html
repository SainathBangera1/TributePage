                <h3>Early Life</h3>
                <p>
                    William Carey, the oldest of five children, was born to Edmund and 
                    Elizabeth Carey, who were weavers by trade, 
                    in the hamlet of Pury End in the parish of Paulerspury.
                </p>
                <p>
                    William was raised in the Church of England; when he was six, his 
                    father was appointed the parish clerk and village schoolmaster. As 
                    a child he was inquisitive and keenly interested in the natural sciences, 
                    particularly botany. He possessed a natural gift for language, teaching 
                    himself Latin.

                <ul id="legacy">
                    <li>In 1785, Carey was appointed the schoolmaster for the village of Moulton.</li>
                    <li>
                        Carey devoted great efforts and time to the study not only of the common language of Bengali, 
                        but to many other Indian vernaculars including the ancient root language of Sanskrit. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In collaboration with the College of Fort William, Carey undertook the translation of the 
                        Hindu classics into English, beginning with the three-volume epic poem the Ramayana.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        He then translated the Bible into Bengali, Oriya, Marathi, Hindi, Assamese, Sanskrit and parts 
                        of it into other dialects and languages.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For 30 years Carey served in the college as the professor 
                        of Bengali, Sanskrit and Marathi, publishing, <strong>in 1805, the first book on Marathi grammar.</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In 1794 Carey opened, at his own cost, what is considered the <strong>first primary school in all of India.</strong> 
                        The public school system that Carey initiated expanded to include girls in an era when the education 
                        of the female was considered unthinkable.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In 1820 Carey founded the <strong>Agri Horticultural Society of India at Alipore, Calcutta</strong>, supporting his enthusiasm for botany.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Serampore Trio - William Ward, William Carey, & Joshua Marshman, started the college with 37 students in 1818.
